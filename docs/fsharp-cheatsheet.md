<a name="Comments"></a>Comments
--------
Block comments are placed between `(*` and `*)`. Line comments start from `//` and continue until the end of the line.

    (* This is block comment *)

    // And this is line comment

XML doc comments come after `///` allowing us to use XML tags to generate documentation.

    /// The `let` keyword defines an (immutable) value
    let result = 1 + 1 = 2

<a name="Strings"></a>Strings
-------
F# `string` type is an alias for `System.String` type.

    /// Create a string using string concatenation
    let hello = "Hello" + " World"

Use *verbatim strings* preceded by `@` symbol to avoid escaping control characters (except escaping `"` by `""`).

    let verbatimXml = @"<book title=""Paradise Lost"">"

We don't even have to escape `"` with *triple-quoted strings*.

    let tripleXml = """<book title="Paradise Lost">"""

*Backslash strings* indent string contents by stripping leading spaces.

    let poem =
        "The lesser world was daubed\n\
         By a colorist of modest skill\n\
         A master limned you in the finest inks\n\
         And with a fresh-cut quill."

<a name="BasicTypesAndLiterals"></a>Basic Types and Literals
------------------------
Most numeric types have associated suffixes, e.g., `uy` for unsigned 8-bit integers and `L` for signed 64-bit integer.

    let b, i, l = 86uy, 86, 86L

    // [fsi:val b : byte = 86uy]
    // [fsi:val i : int = 86]
    // [fsi:val l : int64 = 86L]

Other common examples are `F` or `f` for 32-bit floating-point numbers, `M` or `m` for decimals, and `I` for big integers.

    let s, f, d, bi = 4.14F, 4.14, 0.7833M, 9999I

    // [fsi:val s : float32 = 4.14f]
    // [fsi:val f : float = 4.14]
    // [fsi:val d : decimal = 0.7833M]
    // [fsi:val bi : System.Numerics.BigInteger = 9999]

<a name="Functions"></a>Functions
---------
The `let` keyword also defines named functions.

    let negate x = x * -1
    let square x = x * x
    let print x = printfn "The number is: %d" x

    let squareNegateThenPrint x =
        print (negate (square x))

### Pipe and composition operators
Pipe operator `|>` is used to chain functions and arguments together. Double-backtick identifiers are handy to improve readability especially in unit testing:

    let ``square, negate, then print`` x =
        x |> square |> negate |> print

This operator can assist the F# type checker by providing type information before use:

    let sumOfLengths (xs : string []) =
        xs 
        |> Array.map (fun s -> s.Length)
        |> Array.sum

Composition operator `>>` is used to compose functions:

    let squareNegateThenPrint' =
        square >> negate >> print
  
### Recursive functions
The `rec` keyword is used together with the `let` keyword to define a recursive function:

    let rec fact x =
        if x < 1 then 1
        else x * fact (x - 1)

*Mutually recursive* functions (those functions which call each other) are indicated by `and` keyword:

    let rec even x =
        if x = 0 then true
        else odd (x - 1)

    and odd x =
        if x = 0 then false
        else even (x - 1)

<a name="PatternMatching"></a>Pattern Matching
----------------
Pattern matching is often facilitated through `match` keyword.

    let rec fib n =
        match n with
        | 0 -> 0
        | 1 -> 1
        | _ -> fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)

In order to match sophisticated inputs, one can use `when` to create filters or guards on patterns:

    let sign x = 
        match x with
        | 0 -> 0
        | x when x < 0 -> -1
        | x -> 1

Pattern matching can be done directly on arguments:

    let fst' (x, _) = x

or implicitly via `function` keyword:

    /// Similar to `fib`; using `function` for pattern matching
    let rec fib' = function
        | 0 -> 0
        | 1 -> 1
        | n -> fib' (n - 1) + fib' (n - 2)

<a name="Collections"></a>Collections
-----------

### Lists
A *list* is an immutable collection of elements of the same type.

    // Lists use square brackets and `;` delimiter
    let list1 = [ "a"; "b" ]
    // :: is prepending
    let list2 = "c" :: list1
    // @ is concat
    let list3 = list1 @ list2

    // Recursion on list using (::) operator
    let rec sum list = 
        match list with
        | [] -> 0
        | x :: xs -> x + sum xs

### Arrays
*Arrays* are fixed-size, zero-based, mutable collections of consecutive data elements.

    // Arrays use square brackets with bar
    let array1 = [| "a"; "b" |]
    // Indexed access using dot
    let first = array1.[0]
 
### Sequences
A *sequence* is a logical series of elements of the same type. Individual sequence elements are computed only as required, so a sequence can provide better performance than a list in situations in which not all the elements are used.

    // Sequences can use yield and contain subsequences
    let seq1 = 
        seq {
            // "yield" adds one element
            yield 1
            yield 2
    
            // "yield!" adds a whole subsequence
            yield! [5..10]
        }

### Higher-order functions on collections
The same list `[ 1; 3; 5; 7; 9 ]` or array `[| 1; 3; 5; 7; 9 |]` can be generated in various ways.

 - Using range operator `..`
    
        let xs = [ 1..2..9 ]

 - Using list or array comprehensions
    
        let ys = [| for i in 0..4 -> 2 * i + 1 |]

 - Using `init` function

        let zs = List.init 5 (fun i -> 2 * i + 1)

Lists and arrays have comprehensive sets of higher-order functions for manipulation.

  - `fold` starts from the left of the list (or array) and `foldBack` goes in the opposite direction
     
        let xs' =
            Array.fold (fun str n -> 
                sprintf "%s,%i" str n) "" [| 0..9 |]

  - `reduce` doesn't require an initial accumulator
  
        let last xs = List.reduce (fun acc x -> x) xs

  - `map` transforms every element of the list (or array)

        let ys' = Array.map (fun x -> x * x) [| 0..9 |]

  - `iter`ate through a list and produce side effects
         
        let _ = List.iter (printfn "%i") [ 0..9 ] 

All these operations are also available for sequences. The added benefits of sequences are laziness and uniform treatment of all collections implementing `IEnumerable<'T>`.

    let zs' =
        seq { 
            for i in 0..9 do
                printfn "Adding %d" i
                yield i
        }

<a name="TuplesAndRecords"></a>Tuples and Records
------------------
A *tuple* is a grouping of unnamed but ordered values, possibly of different types:

    // Tuple construction
    let x = (1, "Hello")

    // Triple
    let y = ("one", "two", "three") 

    // Tuple deconstruction / pattern
    let (a', b') = x

The first and second elements of a tuple can be obtained using `fst`, `snd`, or pattern matching:

    let c' = fst (1, 2)
    let d' = snd (1, 2)
    
    let print' tuple =
        match tuple with
        | (a, b) -> printfn "Pair %A %A" a b

*Records* represent simple aggregates of named values, optionally with members:

    // Declare a record type
    type Person = { Name : string; Age : int }

    // Create a value via record expression
    let paul = { Name = "Paul"; Age = 28 }

    // 'Copy and update' record expression
    let paulsTwin = { paul with Name = "Jim" }

Records can be augmented with properties and methods:

    type Person with
        member x.Info = (x.Name, x.Age)

Records are essentially sealed classes with extra topping: default immutability, structural equality, and pattern matching support.

    let isPaul person =
        match person with
        | { Name = "Paul" } -> true
        | _ -> false

<a name="DiscriminatedUnions"></a>Discriminated Unions
--------------------
*Discriminated unions* (DU) provide support for values that can be one of a number of named cases, each possibly with different values and types.

    type Tree<'T> =
        | Node of Tree<'T> * 'T * Tree<'T>
        | Leaf


    let rec depth = function
        | Node(l, _, r) -> 1 + max (depth l) (depth r)
        | Leaf -> 0

F# Core has built-in discriminated unions for error handling, e.g., [`option`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/options) and [`Result`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/results).

    let optionPatternMatch input =
        match input with
        | Some i -> printfn "input is an int=%d" i
        | None -> printfn "input is missing"

Single-case discriminated unions are often used to create type-safe abstractions with pattern matching support:

    type OrderId = Order of string

    // Create a DU value
    let orderId = Order "12"

    // Use pattern matching to deconstruct single-case DU
    let (Order id) = orderId

<a name="Exceptions"></a>Exceptions
----------
The `failwith` function throws an exception of type `Exception`.

    let divideFailwith x y =
        if y = 0 then 
            failwith "Divisor cannot be zero." 
        else x / y

Exception handling is done via `try/with` expressions.

    let divide x y =
        try
            Some (x / y)
        with :? System.DivideByZeroException -> 
            printfn "Division by zero!"
            None
    
The `try/finally` expression enables you to execute clean-up code even if a block of code throws an exception. Here's an example which also defines custom exceptions.

    exception InnerError of string
    exception OuterError of string
    
    let handleErrors x y =
        try 
            try 
                if x = y then raise (InnerError("inner"))
                else raise (OuterError("outer"))
            with InnerError(str) -> 
                printfn "Error1 %s" str
        finally
            printfn "Always print this."

<a name="ClassesAndInheritance"></a>Classes and Inheritance
-----------------------
This example is a basic class with (1) local let bindings, (2) properties, (3) methods, and (4) static members.

    type Vector(x : float, y : float) =
        let mag = sqrt(x * x + y * y) // (1)
        member _.X = x // (2)
        member _.Y = y
        member _.Mag = mag
        member _.Scale(s) = // (3)
            Vector(x * s, y * s)
        static member (+) (a : Vector, b : Vector) = // (4)
            Vector(a.X + b.X, a.Y + b.Y)

Call a base class from a derived one.

    type Animal() =
        member _.Rest() = ()

    type Dog() =
        inherit Animal()
        member _.Run() =
            base.Rest()

*Upcasting* is denoted by `:>` operator.

    let dog = Dog() 
    let animal = dog :> Animal

*Dynamic downcasting* (`:?>`) might throw an `InvalidCastException` if the cast doesn't succeed at runtime.

    let shouldBeADog = animal :?> Dog

<a name="InterfacesAndObjectExpressions"></a>Interfaces and Object Expressions
---------------------------------
Declare `IVector` interface and implement it in `Vector'`.

    type IVector =
        abstract Scale : float -> IVector
    
    type Vector'(x, y) =
        interface IVector with
            member __.Scale(s) =
                Vector'(x * s, y * s) :> IVector
        member _.X = x
        member _.Y = y

Another way of implementing interfaces is to use *object expressions*.

    type ICustomer =
        abstract Name : string
        abstract Age : int
    
    let createCustomer name age =
        {   new ICustomer with
                member __.Name = name
                member __.Age = age }

<a name="ActivePatterns"></a>Active Patterns
---------------
*Single-case active patterns*:

    // Basic
    let (|EmailDomain|) (email: string) =
        let parts = email.Split '@'
        parts[1]
    let (EmailDomain emailDomain) = "yennefer@aretuza.org" // emailDomain = 'aretuza.org'

    // As Parameters
    let (|Real|) (x: System.Numerics.Complex) =
        (x.Real, x.Imaginary)
    let addReal (Real aa) (Real bb) = // conversion done in the parameters
        fst aa + fst bb
    let addRealOut = addReal System.Numerics.Complex.ImaginaryOne System.Numerics.Complex.ImaginaryOne

    // Parameterized
    let (|Default|) onNone value =
        match value with
        | None -> onNone
        | Some e -> e
    let (Default "random citizen" name) = None // name = "random citizen"
    let (Default "random citizen" name) = Some "Steve" // name = "Steve"

*Single-case active patterns* can be thought of as a simple way to convert data to a new form.

*Complete active patterns*:

    let (|Even|Odd|) i = 
        if i % 2 = 0 then Even else Odd
    
    let testNumber i =
        match i with
        | Even -> printfn "%d is even" i
        | Odd -> printfn "%d is odd" i

    let (|Phone|Email|) (s:string) =
        if s.Contains '@' then Email $"Email: {s}" else Phone $"Phone: {s}"

    match "yennefer@aretuza.org" with // output: "Email: yennefer@aretuza.org"
    | Email email -> printfn $"{email}"
    | Phone phone -> printfn $"{phone}"

*Partial active patterns*:

    let (|DivisibleBy|_|) by n = 
        if n % by = 0 then Some DivisibleBy else None
    
    let fizzBuzz = function 
        | DivisibleBy 3 & DivisibleBy 5 -> "FizzBuzz" 
        | DivisibleBy 3 -> "Fizz" 
        | DivisibleBy 5 -> "Buzz" 
        | i -> string i

*Partial active patterns* share the syntax of parameterized patterns but their active recognizers accept only one argument.

<a name="CompilerDirectives"></a>Compiler Directives
-------------------
Load another F# source file into FSI.

    #load "../lib/StringParsing.fs"

Reference a .NET assembly (`/` symbol is recommended for Mono compatibility).
Reference a .NET assembly:
    
    #r "../lib/FSharp.Markdown.dll"

Reference a nuget package

    #r "nuget:Serilog.Sinks.Console" // latest production release
    #r "nuget: FSharp.Data, 6.3.0" // specific version
