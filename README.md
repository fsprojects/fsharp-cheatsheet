An F# Cheatsheet in Markup and HTML formats

## Introduction

The raw content of this cheatsheet can be edited at [fsharp-cheatsheet.md](docs/fsharp-cheatsheet.md).

## Contributing

This resource was, is and should remain a community effort. If you're learning F# and something important you didn't learn about isn't covered, you're the very best person to point that out and phrase it in a way that someone new can get running with. If someone posts a PR, the more diversity of reviewers we get, the better. That said, the best PRs are small ones that touch one piece at a time and can hence be reviewed and merged rapidly.
